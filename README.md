### Capnp Nodejs Wrapper Demo

For this demo I have build and deploy my capnp from original wrapper and named as capnp-jcm@0.12.0

This is based on ` Cap'n Proto version 0.7.0 ` and 'nodejs' version 12.0.0.

Note: 
- I didn't try to compile it with higher node version.
- The npm package which I have deployed can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capnp-jcm).


### Install

```nodejs
npm install  # Make sure you have installed cap'n proto before running this command
```
